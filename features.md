# Project Outline

## 1. Core Features
- RAG over existing notebooks to locate related `src/` code
- It should first ask the user what notebook they want to generate, giving a few suggested notebook ideas
- Then, it should ask what research they want to do, and use Tavily + ArXiv retriever to gather relevant papers
- It should then generate an outline for the notebook, get user feedback, and then generate the actual code cells
- It should have the following core features:
- Use jupyter-mcp-server to interact with the notebook 
- Use supervisor, research, generative, and reflective agent roles
- support voice commands using ElevenLabs STT, transcribe to words, then get an agent to do its task


- Package everything together in a jupyterlab extension for easy installation
- including jupyterlab 4.49, python LSP server, and optional AI autocomplete


- Next Edit Prediction
- ElevenLabs voice controls
- Notebook summarizer with mindmap/Table of Contents generation
- Generate an outline, get feedback, and then the actual code
- If possible, integrate with Inkscape MCP as well

## 2. Research Integrations
- Tavily tool-calls for literature search
- ArXiv retrieval (via LangGraph retriever)

## 3. Agent Roles
- Supervisor (routing/coordination)
- Research (Tavily + ArXiv external knowledge)
- Generative (memory + planning)
- Reflective (meta-learning from errors)

## 4. Notebook Utilities
- RAG over existing notebooks to locate related `src/` code
- Detect duplicate/overlapping notebooks in the workspace
- Summarize notebooks and surface key entities/links

## 5. Environment & DX
- JupyterLab 4.49
- Python LSP server for completion and diagnostics
- Optional AI autocomplete
```

Core Feature Areas
- Next Edit Prediction: proactively suggest the userâ€™s likely next code change.
- ElevenLabs voice controls: voice input/output for hands-free interactions.
- Notebook summarizer: generate concise summaries and a mindmap/ToC per notebook.

Research Integrations
- Tavily tool-calls to search research papers, emphasizing survey/meta-analysis papers.
- ArXiv retriever in LangGraph for targeted literature RAG.

Agent Roles
- Supervisor: routes requests and coordinates sub-agents.
- Research: queries Tavily/ArXiv and compiles findings.
- Generative: plans tasks, maintains working memory, and produces drafts.
- Reflective: reviews errors/outcomes and updates strategies.

Notebook Utilities
- RAG notebooks to find whether referenced Python code already exists in `src/`.
- Detect duplicates or near-duplicates among notebooks in the folder.
- Summarize notebooks and surface cross-references or missing links.

Environment & Developer Experience
- Target: JupyterLab 4.49.
- Bundle Python LSP server for autocompletion and error checking.
- Include an AI autocomplete option if feasible.

Suggested Research and Readings
- Agents and orchestration
  - Search queries: "agentic workflows survey", "LLM multi-agent systems survey", "supervisor agent coordination"
- RAG and retrieval
  - Search queries: "retrieval augmented generation best practices", "RAG for notebooks", "arxiv retriever langgraph"
- Planning and reflection
  - Search queries: "LLM planning with memory", "reflective agents meta-learning", "error-driven self-reflection LLM"
- Next edit prediction
  - Search queries: "next edit prediction code", "code change prediction LLM", "intent-aware code suggestion"
- Voice interfaces
  - Search queries: "LLM voice control pipeline", "text-to-speech ElevenLabs integration", "speech-to-text notebook workflow"
- Notebook summarization
  - Search queries: "notebook summarization arxiv", "mindmap generation from documents", "entity extraction notebooks"

Immediate Next Steps
- Define minimal LangGraph graph: supervisor, research, generative, reflective nodes.
- Add ArXiv retriever + Tavily tools and test end-to-end query flow.
- Implement notebook RAG index and duplicate detection for the workspace.
- Prototype Next Edit Prediction as a background suggestion service.
- Integrate Python LSP and confirm JupyterLab 4.49 setup.
